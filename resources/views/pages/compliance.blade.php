		Claims Legal Ltd are regulated by the claims management regulator in respect of regulated claims
		management activities. It is a criminal offense to work in this sector without proper authorisation.
		</p>
		<p id="contentp">
		Claims Management Regulation Unit is a division of the Ministry of Justice and ultimately gives all rules and
		procedures for claims management companies who they authorise. Rules and Compliance come from a whole
		range of specific industry rules that run alongside all other regulatory requirements and laws of the land.
		</p>
		<p id="contentp">
		The Claims Management Regulator also monitor firms, carry out audit inspections and deal with illegal and
		non-compliant practice by authorised and unauthorised firms and individuals.
		</p>
		<p id="contentp">
		We respect our regulator, our license and the position of authority and trust bestowed in us as license holders.
		Claims management companies have had some bad press over the years, and bad news always travels quicker
		and faster than good news, but as an ever increasing choice by many consumers, and the ever changing legal
		world, claims management is here to stay for the foreseeable future. What will change is the professionalism of
		firms as the regulator and Legal Ombudsman regulate firms a lot closer and take more action against those
		who break the rules.
