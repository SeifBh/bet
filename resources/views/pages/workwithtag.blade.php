	                    At The Accident Guys, we understand that getting back on your own two feet after an
	                    accident can be sometimes tiring and difficult to say the least.In addition to any Personal
	                    Injuries that you suffered due to an accident, you may have also had financial losses due to
	                    not being able to attend your normal employment for a number of weeks or months, having
	                    been paid statutory sick pay or even losing your job and income totally. The Accident Guys
	                    help everyday people claim the Personal Injury Compensation they deserve and need.
	                </p>

					specifically ask for us to contact them in regards to their specific circumstances, submit
					their name and telephone number through the App and let us do our work. That's all you
					have to do. The App tracks your recommendation and if a panel solicitor accepts a client's
					file and the client gives signed instructions to the solicitor, we pay you a share of our
					marketing fees.
