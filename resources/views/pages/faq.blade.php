                No. You are not there to give advice. Your role is to tell people who we are and what we do - and that’s it. The more you get to know us, the more you can tell people about us from direct experience. We also do not give legal advice. This is the job of a fully qualified panel solicitor who we match our clients to, depending on the individual circumstances and specific matters. We do not contract with the client, and only when they have spoken directly to a solicitor and confirmed their instructions will they be invited to sign and the solicitor represent the matter.

           The Accident Guys make a preliminary review with the client to see there is enough basic information to assist a solicitor review a matter in full. A solicitor is not a private detective and adequate proof of liability along with information of who the claim is to be made against should be supplied to enable the solicitor to make an informed decision as to whether the case has merit and an adequate chance of being successful. They don’t want to waste your time or theirs. Other factors are checked like statutory time limits to make a claim, and if all basic criteria information is available then we will match the client to and recommend the service of a panel solicitor who works in this specific field. The client then has a choice to contact the solicitor or not.
